# Chemyx Syringe Pump Controller 

This project is built on top of the original Chemyx Syringe Pump repository from https://github.com/cukelarter/Chemyx-Syringe-Pump.

## What's New

This version adds a comprehensive GUI interface (`my_chemyx_gui.py`) built with PyQt6 that provides:

- Visual step-based pump programming
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Save/load program functionality
- Manual jog controls
- Connection management interface

## Getting Started

For detailed installation and setup instructions, see [setup.md](setup.md).

## Quick Start

1. Install Python 3.8+ and required dependencies
2. Run `run_chemyx.bat` to launch the GUI
3. Configure your pump settings in the Configuration tab
4. Create and execute pump programs in the Program tab
