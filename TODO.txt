In no particular order:

13. can't dynamically tell when pump is d/c or run stops on its own
	a. would take a while to iron out all possible ways to exit
	b. is it really needed?
	c. is there a serial variable to check? pump.status()?
12. Values not updating properly when outside of operational range
	a. ex: 1 micro liter of syringe diameter 20
	b. does serial response throw error code?
4. Additional gui features:
	a. Saving parameters
	c. multi-step features
5. blank variable behavior
	a. currently just uses defaults set when initializing
7. GUI export as exe?
	a. just for s&g really
	b. need to package logo resource
8. fix form resizing when connecting and disconnecting
	a. or don't because its locked anyways
11. please for the love of god add a way to remove beeping


DONE

1. Separate sending commands from start so it can function to unpause correctly	
 - Pause and Unpause on same button, start still updates all pump vars
3. Lockout of serial connection
	a. if disconnect isn't pressed before closing out, port becomes locked
	b. add self.closeConnection when closing window
 - added closeEvent listener that closes connection

6. scan for com ports in gui
	a. QComboBox.clear()
	b. lisener for when clicking on combobox?
	c. scan button is more readable/userfriendly
 - added scan button next to port selection box

9. lock connection variables when connected
 - used wdiget.setEnabled()

10. pump variables not updating properly
 - merged updating and sending to same step, with error if they miss any

2. Investigate multistep issues
	a. just weren't running correctly? 
	b. super weird behavior, screen glitches. what the fuck
 - need to be in multi-step screen before running multistep code
