In no particular order:

4. Additional gui features:
	a. Saving parameters
	c. multi-step features
 - not needed
7. GUI export as exe?
	a. just for s&g really
	b. need to package logo resource
 - Shelved, NI exe will be developed at later date
8. fix form resizing when connecting and disconnecting
	a. or don't because its locked anyways
 - Who cares?
11. please for the love of god add a way to remove beeping
 - Never gonna happen
14. Negative pump values
	a. pump doesnt allow for negative volume?
 - removed "bottom"

DONE

1. Separate sending commands from start so it can function to unpause correctly	
 - Pause and Unpause on same button, start still updates all pump vars
3. Lockout of serial connection
	a. if disconnect isn't pressed before closing out, port becomes locked
	b. add self.closeConnection when closing window
 - added closeEvent listener that closes connection

6. scan for com ports in gui
	a. QComboBox.clear()
	b. lisener for when clicking on combobox?
	c. scan button is more readable/userfriendly
 - added scan button next to port selection box

9. lock connection variables when connected
 - used wdiget.setEnabled()

10. pump variables not updating properly
 - merged updating and sending to same step, with error if they miss any

2. Investigate multistep issues
	a. just weren't running correctly? 
	b. super weird behavior, screen glitches. what the fuck
 - need to be in multi-step screen before running multistep code
 
5. blank variable behavior
	a. currently just uses defaults set when initializing
 - throws an error if any are empty


12. Values not updating properly when outside of operational range
	a. ex: 1 micro liter of syringe diameter 20
	b. does serial response throw error code?
	c. validation step?
 - Validation step called after sending from GUI, should clean up a little bit

15. baudrate of 38400 not working properly
	a. serial port is opening correctly, but fails when sending variables over
 - Must be set on pump before being set in gui/code, added warning in label

13. can't dynamically tell when pump is d/c or run stops on its own
	a. would take a while to iron out all possible ways to exit
	b. is it really needed?
	c. is there a serial variable to check? pump.status()?
 - Pump responds correctly regardless
